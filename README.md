# cd-ripper -- Headless CD ripper

Collection of scripts and configurations for a headless CD rip system based raspberry pi.

Typical usage:
 1. trigger on new inserted disc
 2. rip CD using abcde, converting to FLAC
 3. move the result to NAS
 4. eject CD

The goal is to have as little interaction as possible and keep feeding CDs as soon as the tray opens.
